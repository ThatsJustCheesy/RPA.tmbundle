# RPA.tmbundle

TextMate bundle that adds highlighting for RPA’s BNF-style grammar definitions.

From [RPA Toolkit](http://www.rpatk.net/web/en/index.php "RPA Toolkit | Home"):
> The Regular Pattern Analyzer Library (RPA) is a top-down recursive parser and pattern matching engine. The input grammar notation is Backus–Naur Form (BNF) and the produced output is a browsable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

To install:

1. Clone this repository to your desktop.
2. Rename the folder to “RPA.tmbundle”.
3. Double-click the renamed folder. When TextMate prompts you, install the new bundle.
